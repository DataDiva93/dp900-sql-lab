## ‚úÖ Objective

Understand and explore SQL data types used in Azure databases.

- Numeric, character, date/time, binary, and spatial data types
- How to choose the right data type for performance and storage

---

## üîç What I Learned

- VARCHAR vs NVARCHAR ‚Äî use NVARCHAR for Unicode (e.g., emojis or international chars)
- INT vs BIGINT ‚Äî use wisely based on expected value range
- DATE and DATETIME ‚Äî DATETIME includes time to the second

---

## üí° Personal Notes

- Avoid using `TEXT` or `NTEXT` ‚Äî they‚Äôre deprecated
- Always think about **range and storage size** when picking numeric types
- Azure SQL gives warnings when casting data incorrectly ‚Äî pay attention!

## üß™ Sample Queries

```sql
-- Check data types in a table
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'Product';

-- Example of type casting
SELECT CAST(ListPrice AS INT) AS RoundedPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product;
